🏥 Trauma Center Access Analysis Based on Incident Zones

📄 Overview:
    This project, done entirely in Python, analyzes access to trauma centers in Kolkata, India, based on multiple incident points and multiple trauma center locations. Using open-source geospatial tools and network analysis, the pipeline computes shortest-path distances and travel times from each incident point to all trauma centers, generating a multi-origin multi-destination (OD) cost matrix. Routes are classified into Safe, Warning, and Danger zones based on travel time, and results are visualized in interactive maps. The workflow integrates data collection, geospatial processing, OD computation, and GIS-ready outputs.
